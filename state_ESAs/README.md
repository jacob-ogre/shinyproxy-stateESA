## state-ESAs

An R [flexdashboard](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/index.html) for
exploring data on state endangered species laws.

### Background

Various proposals have been put forth to devolve legal authority to the states 
to protect and recover imperiled species. But state endangered species laws 
need to be as strong, if not stronger, than the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA)
for imperiled species to benefit from such a move. 

Scholars at the [UC Irvine School of Law Center for Land, Environment, and Natural
Resources (CLEANR)](http://www.law.uci.edu/academics/centers/cleanr/) 
collected and analyzed data on 16 elements of endangered species law from all 
50 states. Their report, [_Conservation Limited: Assessing the Limitations of State Laws and 
Resources for Endangered Species Protection_](http://www.law.uci.edu/academics/centers/cleanr/news-pdfs/cleanr-esa-report-final.pdf),
indicates that few states have laws that are as protective, at least on paper,
as the US ESA. The data underlying the paper can be explored using this simple
flexdashboard app, which was written by Defenders of Wildlife.
